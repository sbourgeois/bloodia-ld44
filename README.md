Bloodia
-------

A short roguelike where life, money and time share a single counter.

This game was done in 48h, from scratch, for the Ludum Dare #44 Compo. Theme was "Your Life is Currency".

Everything (code, sprites, sounds, music) has been created exclusively on an iPad Pro, using [Pyxen](https://pyxen.com) and [Reflow](https://reflow.app).
